OpenPegasus is an open-source implementationof the DMTF CIM and WBEM standards. 
It is designed to be portable and highly modular. It is coded in C++ so that it 
effectively translates the object concepts of the CIM objects into a programming 
model but still retains the speed and efficiency of a compiled language. 
OpenPegasus is designed to be inherently portable and builds and runs today on 
most versionsof UNIX(R), Linux, OpenVMS, and Microsoft Windows.
